# Piwap
Piwap stand for Pictures Warping App. It warps pictures. 

This is a small project I started to create a Phatch-like interface above a c++ backend (right now it is image-magick). 

Piwap is published under the GPL License. For the moment it is still under heavy devellopement and I will only provide appimages for Linux. In the future I might setup a better build environnement to target windows too.

Currently Piwap support a limited set of operations to resize images, set a background color and saving/renaming/moving files. I'm looking for inputs. Feel free to use github issue tracker to propose operations you'd like to see implemented and to report bugs.
